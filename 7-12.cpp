/*
Each input file contains one test case. 
Each case starts with a line containing two positive integers N (≤100), the number of activity check points (hence it is assumed that the check points are numbered from 0 to N−1), 
and M, the number of activities. 
Then M lines follow, each gives the description of an activity. For the i-th activity, three non-negative numbers are given: S[i], E[i], and L[i], where S[i] is the index of the starting check point, E[i] of the ending check point, and L[i] the lasting time of the activity. The numbers in a line are separated by a space.
